# odin-recipes

This project is to practice what I learned so far following The Odin Project in regards to HTML. I will be building a basic recipe website. There will be a main index page that links to a few recipes. It will look basic for now until I learn about CSS where I can come back and update the project with style.

Some of the skills that will be demonstrated are setting up the boilerplate, correct usage of basic HTML tags and attributes within them, practice with using anchor tags to link recipes, and hopefully include some images.
