    <h4>Steps to Create the Dish</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Mung Beans:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Soak 1 cup of mung beans in water for at least 1 hour or overnight. Drain and blend half with coconut milk until smooth. Set aside the other half for steaming.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Mix the Batter:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the mung bean mixture, rice flour, cornstarch, water, scallions, turmeric, sugar, and salt. Mix well and let the batter rest for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Prepare the Fillings:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Add the pork, shrimp, and onion. Cook until the shrimp is pink and cooked through, then set aside.</li>
          <li>Steam the remaining mung beans until tender.</li>
