    <h4>The glistening, culinary masterpiece, roast duck made the Chinese way.</h4>

    <p>The recipe for roast duck from The Woks of Life describes a traditional method for preparing a flavorful and aromatic Chinese roast duck. The duck is first seasoned inside with a blend of spices, including five-spice powder and sand ginger powder. It is then marinated with a cooked sauce made from chee hou sauce, hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, and fermented bean curd, among other ingredients.</p>
    <p>A key step involves inflating the duck's skin to separate it from the meat, which helps achieve a crispy texture. The duck is then bathed in a hot water and vinegar solution to further tighten the skin and give it a distinctive dark color. After air-drying overnight, the duck is roasted until the skin is perfectly crispy and the meat is tender. The result is a richly flavored roast duck, ideal for serving with rice and vegetables.</p>
